niese you pretty much answered your own question. A single API call that generates the data required is better than a blind iteration that then requires an extra calls for each value found to check whether it's actually the correct value. Object.keys might generate a new array, but the time required to do that is far less than the time required to call that .hasOwnProperty check for each attribute, and you're not going to see a spike in your memory profile from the arrays created by Object.keys under for-webpage conditions (for-custom-engines conditions are a different beast) – Mike 'Pomax' Kamermans Jan 12 '14 at 16:05
